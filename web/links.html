		<h3 id="web">Introduction to Web</h3>
		<div>
			Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server. The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it usually sends some type of content to the client. The client uses web browser to send request to the server. The server often sends response to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML(HyperText Markup Language). All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client.

		<h3 id="client-server">Client-Server</h3>
		<div>
				Client-server is a relationship in which one program, the client, requests a service or resource from another program, the server. The label client-server was previously used to distinguish distributed computing by PCs from the monolithic, centralized computing model used by mainframes.Today, computer transactions in which the server fulfills a request made by a client are very common. The client-server model has become one of the central ideas of network computing. In this context, the client establishes a connection to the server over a LAN or WAN, such as the internet.

		<div>
			<ol>
			 	<li>Custom Elements</li>
				<pre>
These are fully valid HTML elements with custom templates, behaviors, and tag names (e.g. <dialog>) made with a set of JavaScript APIs. Custom Elements are defined in the HTML Living Standard specification.
				</pre>
				<li>Shadow DOM</li>

(Definition from the developer Mozilla) An important aspect of web components is encapsulation, and able to keep the markup structure, style, and behavior hidden and separate from other code on the page so that different parts do not clash,

     			Isolated DOM</li>
A component’s DOM is self-contained (e.g. document.querySelector() won’t return nodes in the component’s shadow DOM). This also simplifies the CSS selectors across your web app since DOM components are isolated, and it gives you the ability to use more generic id/class names without worrying about naming conflicts.
    Scoped CSS: CSS defined inside shadow DOM is scoped to it. Style rules don’t leak out and page styles don’t interfere with it.
    Composition: Design a declarative, markup-based API for your component.

The above features are provided by shadow dom, let's see the code for shadow dom,

3.HTML Template

User-defined templates in HTML that aren’t rendered until called upon, fragments of markup that go unused at page load, but can be instantiated later on at runtime.

The <template> tag is defined in the HTML Living Standard specification.

We can implement reusable HTML structure using <template> and <slot> elements
