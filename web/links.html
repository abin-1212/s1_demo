		<div>
			Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server. The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it usually sends some type of content to the client. The client uses web browser to send request to the server. The server often sends response to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML(HyperText Markup Language). All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client.

				Client-server is a relationship in which one program, the client, requests a service or resource from another program, the server. The label client-server was previously used to distinguish distributed computing by PCs from the monolithic, centralized computing model used by mainframes.Today, computer transactions in which the server fulfills a request made by a client are very common. The client-server model has become one of the central ideas of network computing. In this context, the client establishes a connection to the server over a LAN or WAN, such as the internet.
